# Random-What-To-Cook-For-Lunch-Generator

This is a very basic PowerShell Script that we use to choose from a list of dishes what to cook on the weekend. All you need to run this is fill out the variables needed and configure a scheduled job on one of your Windows machines.

Variables needed (as shown in the script):
 
where to store the database?
$db_path = "C\tmp"

settings for smtp
$smtp_address = "your smtp mail adress"
$smtp_login = "your smtp login"
$smtp_password = "your smtp password"
$smtp_server = "your smtp server"

who shall receive the mail
$mail_recipients = "test1@gmail.com","test2@gmail.com"

main food array, enter food choices here (12+ choices recommended)
$food_array =
"food_choice_1",
"food_choice_2",
"food_choice_3",
"food_choice_4",
"food_choice_5",
"food_choice_6",
"food_choice_7",
"food_choice_8",
"food_choice_9",
"food_choice_10",
"food_choice_11",
"food_choice_12"
 
 The script itself will prioritize the dishes by frequency and use the dishes with the lowest frequency first. It will also not use the last X dishes and make sure there will not be the same dish on Saturday and Sunday. Me and my wife both get a mail every Thursday morning (before we do our grocery shopping for the weekend) with what to cook.
